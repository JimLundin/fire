# base_currency_code
In the foreign exchange (forex) market, currency units are quoted as currency pairs. The base currency â€“ also called the transaction currency - is the first currency appearing in a currency pair quotation, followed by the second part of the quotation, called the quote currency or the counter currency.

In forex, the base currency represents how much of the quote currency is needed for you to get one unit of the base currency. For example, if you were looking at the CAD/USD currency pair, the Canadian dollar would be the base currency and the U.S. dollar would be the quote currency.

The abbreviations used for currencies are prescribed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These codes are provided in ISO standard 4217. Currency pairs use these codes made of three letters to represent a particular currency. Currencies constituting a currency pair are sometimes separated with a slash character. The slash may be omitted or replaced by a period, a dash or nothing.
