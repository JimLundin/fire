# regulated
Parameter to define whether the loan product is regulated or unregulated.

Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML):

> "The purpose of a loan determines whether or not it falls within the scope of FCA (sic) regulation. Generally, bridging lending secured by a charge over owner-occupied property is regulated, whereas loans secured on non owner-occupied property (to a property investor, for example) is not. So the market is made up of a mixture of FSA-regulated lenders (which may sometimes also undertake unregulated bridging lending) alongside bridging lenders which undertake no FSA-regulated activity and do not require FSA authorisation or permission."
