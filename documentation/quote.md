# quote
Currencies are quoted in pairs, for example the USD/EUR is the U.S. dollar/euro. Using this quotation, the value of a currency is determined by its comparison to another currency. The first currency of a currency pair is called the base currency, and the second currency is called the quote currency. The currency pair shows how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base currency.

The abbreviations used for currencies are prescribed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These codes are provided in ISO standard 4217. Currency pairs use these codes made of three letters to represent a particular currency. Currencies constituting a currency pair are sometimes separated with a slash character. The slash may be omitted or replaced by a period, a dash or nothing.
