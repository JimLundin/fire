# impairment_type

---


Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement an entity assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a loan or group of loans is impaired. The standard states that a loan is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the exposure was created (the loss event) and that the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the loans and these cash flows can be reliably estimated.

# loan

### collective
To be used if the instrument is subject to impairment in accordance with an applied accounting standard and is collectively assessed for impairment by being grouped together with instruments with similar credit risk characteristics.

### individual
To be used if the instrument is subject to impairment in accordance with an applied accounting standard and is individually assessed for impairment.

### write-off
Write-offs relate to amounts where the lender has no expectation of ever being able to recover value from the collateral or otherwise. It can relate to a financial asset in its entirety or to a portion of it. For example, an entity plans to enforce the collateral on a financial asset and expects to recover no more than 30 per cent of the financial asset from the collateral. If the entity has no reasonable prospects of recovering any further cash flows from the financial asset, it should write off the remaining 70 per cent of the financial asset.
