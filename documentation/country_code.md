# country_code
The **country\_code** represents location, registration, jurisdiction or country of domicile of the product, customer or collateral. This reflects where product or entity is from an operational standpoint rather than a legal point of view (although in many cases it is the same). 

Countries are represented as 2-letter codes in accordance with [ISO 3166-1][iso3166].

See also [**risk_country_code**][rcc].
