**The [REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL][eu] laying down common rules on securitisation and creating a European framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation and amending Directives 2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC, 2011/61/EU and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 648/2012 states that**:

> "Securitisation refers to transactions that enable a lender or other originator of assets – typically a credit institution – to refinance a set of loans or assets (e.g. mortgages, auto leases, consumer loans, credit cards) by converting them into securities. The lender or originator organises a portfolio of its loans into different risk categories, tailored to the risk/reward appetite of investors. Returns to investors are generated from the cash flows of the underlying loans. These markets are not aimed at retail investors."
