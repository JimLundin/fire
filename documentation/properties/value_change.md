# value_change

---

The **value_change** represents the level of increase or decline in the security's price during a 30-day calendar as defined in Article 12 of the [Liquidity Regulations][lcr].

The **value_change** should be recorded as a percentage in decimal format. ie. 3.5% should be represented as 3.5 and not 0.035. There is no restriction to the precision of the number (number of decimal places). A value increase is represented as positive. A value decline is represented as negative.
