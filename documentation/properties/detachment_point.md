# detachment_point

---

The **detachment point** is the threshold at which losses within the pool of underlying exposures would result in a complete loss of principal for the tranche containing the relevant securitisation position. See [determination of detachment point](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook/interactive-single-rulebook/101087).

See also [**attachment_point**](./attachment_point.md).
