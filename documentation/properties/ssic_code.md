The Singapore [**Singapore Standard Industrial Classification**][ssiccode2018] (SSIC) code is the national standard used to classify economic activities undertaken by economic units. The SSIC 2015 (Version 2018) is an update of the SSIC 2015 edition. The SSIC code is designed for use in the collection of data, and furthermore for the compilation, presentation and analysis of a broad range of statistics. The SSIC code adopts the same format as the International Standard Indusrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), however with some modifications to address aspects of Singapore's economic landscape.
