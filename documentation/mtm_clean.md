# mtm_clean
In finance, the **clean price** is the price of a [security/derivative] excluding any interest that has accrued since issue or the most recent coupon payment. This is to be compared with the dirty price, which is the price of a [security/derivative] including the accrued interest.

> **Clean Price = Dirty Price - Accrued Interest**

(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_price)

Bank of England Handbook 20 - [Basic Bond Analysis][boe] (dirty/clean prices with regards to a bond product):

> When a bond is bought or sold midway through a coupon period, a certain amount of
coupon interest will have accrued. The coupon payment is always received by the
person holding the bond at the time of the coupon payment (as the bond will then be
registered in his name). Because he may not have held the bond throughout the
coupon period, he will need to pay the previous holder some ‘compensation’ for the
amount of interest which accrued during his ownership. In order to calculate the
accrued interest, we need to know the number of days in the accrued interest period,
the number of days in the coupon period, and the money amount of the coupon
payment. In most bond markets, accrued interest is calculated on the following
basis:-

> ((Coupon interest) x (no. of days that have passed in coupon period))/(total no of days in the coupon period)

> Prices in the market are usually quoted on a clean basis (i.e. without accrued) but
settled on a dirty basis (i.e. with accrued).
