# end_date
The **end_date** is a widely used property and reflects the contractual maturity date or tenor of the product or relationship. 

The **end date** refers to the final observation or value date for the data in the JSON object. From the recipient's point of view, it is the time stamp for which the data in the JSON object is or will no longer be true. Note that it is called date but allows for precision to the nearest second in accordance with the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).

See also [**date**][date].
