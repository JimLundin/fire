**General Definition (Non-recourse Debt), Wikipedia:**

> [Non-recourse debt][wiki] or a non-recourse loan is a secured loan (debt) that is secured by a pledge of collateral, typically real property, but for which the borrower is not personally liable. If the borrower defaults, the lender can seize and sell the collateral, but if the collateral sells for less than the debt, the lender cannot seek the 'deficiency balance' (the balance outstanding) from the borrower â€” its recovery is limited only to the value of the collateral.
