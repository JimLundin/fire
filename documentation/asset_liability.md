### account  
An account is either an **asset** or a **liability** from the firm's point of view.

An account is considered an [**asset**][asset] if it is a resource controlled by an entity, as a result of a past event, from which economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity. For example, a [credit card account] [Credit cards] is an asset from the issuing entity's point of view, as the issuing entity expects inflows of economic benefits as a result of issuing a credit card account, as the account holder pays annual fees, interest and penalties (if applicable).

An account is considered a [**liability**][liability] if it is a present obligation arising from a past event - the settlement of which is expected to lead to an outflow of future economic beneifts from the entity. For example, a [savings account][Savings account] is a liability from the issuing entity's point of view, as the issuing entity expects the issuance of a savings account to lead to an outflow of future economic benefits from the entity, as the issuer pays interest on the funds in the account to the account holder.

### derivative  
[Derivatives][derivatives] are either a financial **asset** or a financial **liability** on a firm's balance sheet.

A derivative is an **asset** on the firm's balance sheet if it has a positive value with regard to the underlying variable (rate, price, or index).

A derivative is a **liability** on the firm's balance sheet if it has a negative value with regard to the underlying variable (rate, price, or index).

### derivative_cash_flow
A derivative cash flow where two parties exchange cash flows (or assets) derived from an underlying reference index, security or financial instrument will represent either an **asset** or a **liability** on the firm's balance sheet. 

Another term for this exchange is a 'swap'. ([Swaps][swaps] are derivatives where counterparties agree to exchange cash flows or other variables associated with different investments. Many times a swap will occur because one party has a comparative advantage in one area such as borrowing funds under variable interest rates, while another party can borrow more freely as the fixed rate.)

A derivative cash flow exchange (swap) that results in a net positive value after the transaction with regard to the underlying reference index, security or financial instrument is an [**asset**][swap] on the firm's balance sheet.

A derivative cash flow exchange (swap) that results in a net negative value after the transaction with regard to the underlying reference index, security or financial instrument is a [**liability**][swap] on the firm's balance sheet.

### loan  
A loan is either an **asset** or a **liability** for a firm that offers a loan.

A loan is an [**asset**][asset] on a firm's balance sheet when future economic benefits are expected to flow to the firm as a result of issuing the loan. For example, a mortgage offered by a bank is an asset on the bank's balance sheet as repayments are expected in the future.

A loan is a [**liability**][liability] on a firm's balance sheet if future economic benefits are expected to flow out of the firm. For example, if a bank has a mortgage loan on its balance sheet, and repayments are made which are greater than the required repayments, then the bank expects to return the overpayments to the borrower leading to an outflow of future economic benefits.

### security  
A security is valued using either...

1.  [amortised cost][amortisation]: the amount at which the financial instrument is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest rate method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount - this results in the recognition *in profit or loss* over time of the [effective return][effective return] on a financial instrument as the difference between the amount recorded on initial recognition and the ultimate contractual cash flows;

2. [fair value][fair value]: the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. 

[amortisation]: http://www.ifrs.org/Meetings/Documents/FI0411b04Aobs.pdf
[effective return]: http://www.ifrs.org/Meetings/MeetingDocs/IASB/2013/September/06B-Classification%20and%20Measurement.pdf
[fair value]: http://www.iasplus.com/en-gb/standards/ias/ias39

If the valuation leads to expected outflows of economic benefits then the security is a **liability** on the firm's balance sheet. For example if an [equity security][equity security] was purchased by a firm expecting to receieve future inflows of economic benefits through dividend payments, but a market downturn caused a negative fluctuation in dividend payments, the security may have cost more than its expected future value in terms of economic benefit flows - and becomes a **liability** on the firm's balance sheet.

If the valuation leads to expected inflows of economic benefits then the security is an **asset** on the firm's balance sheet. For example, if an [asset backed security][asset backed security] (e.g. collateralised mortgage obligation) was purchased by a firm expecting to receieve future inflows of economic benefits through repayments of those mortgages, and the security was purchased at a value lower than the expected income from those mortgage repayments over the lifetime of the security, then the security will have a net positive fair value and be an **asset** on the firm's balance sheet.
