# status 
The **status** property indicates the current state of the financial product. This is generally used to indicate potential offers committed by the institution (lending decision taken) but not yet accepted by a customer. The status could also indicate liabilities which have been cancelled but are still being held within the dataset (until maturity or otherwise).
