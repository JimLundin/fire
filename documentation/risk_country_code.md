# risk_country_code
The **risk\_country\_code** represents location or jurisdiction of where the risk of the product or entity resides. This can be a subjective field and can depend on a number of factors such as country of domicile, the primary stock exchange on which a product trades, the location from which the majority of its revenue comes, its reporting currency or other factors.

### [FCA's Supervision Manual (Financial Crime Report) - Instrument 2016][fcafcr]:

**Section 1 (Operating jurisdictions to be listed as required for supervisory procedure):**

**3A**: The jurisdictions within which the firm operates as at the end of the reporting period:

> "Select from the list of country codes (in ISO 3166 format), the jurisdictions within which the firm is operating as at the end of the reporting period.
Only those jurisdictions active as at the end of the reporting period should be reported; if a firm terminated operations within a jurisdiction during the reporting period, this jurisdiction does not need to be reported.
‘Operates’ for the purposes of this form is defined as where the firm carries on its business or has a physical presence through a legal entity.
For avoidance of doubt, this definition includes those jurisdictions in which the firm has representative offices. It also includes any jurisdictions where the firm carries on business using a services passport or an establishment passport."

**3B**: Those jurisdictions assessed and considered highrisk by the firm:

> "Select from the list of country codes (in ISO 3166 format), the jurisdictions assessed and considered by the firm to be high-risk. Firms should report any jurisdictions considered high-risk in which they operate and any additional jurisdictions assessed as high-risk by the firm within the previous 2 years, e.g. as part of a Country Risk Assessment.
A firm is not required to report those jurisdictions in which it does not operate or which it has not assessed for risk.
This question should be answered with regard to the firm’s own assessment of risk, which may or may not include the use of available public indices."
