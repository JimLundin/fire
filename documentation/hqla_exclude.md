# hqla_exclude
The **hqla_exlcude** identifier is a boolean to provide a manual override to exclude certain securities from an HQLA report. True indicates to exclude and false to not exclude. 
Note that these exclusions should be justifiable as being for credit enhancement or for operational reasons according to [LCR][lcr] Article 8 and in particular:

> Assets used to provide credit enhancement in structured transactions or to cover operational costs of the credit institutions shall not be deemed as readily accessible to a credit institution.
