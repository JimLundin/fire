# income_amount
The reference income used for a customer(s) for a loan. Monetary type is represented as an integer number of cents/pence.

The Financial Conduct Authority's Mortgages Product Sales Data Glossary defines customer(s) income as the Total Gross Income, which is described as:

> The total of the gross annual incomes (before tax or other deductions) of each of the individual borrowers whose incomes were taken into account when the lender made the lending assessment/ decision. For these purposes, each borrower’s gross income is the sum of that person’s main income and any other reckonable income (e.g., overtime and/or income from other sources, to the extent that the lender takes such additional income into account in whole or in part).

The FCA's Guidance on the Financial Policy Committee’s recommendation on loan to income ratios in mortgage lending further describes an individual's income with regard to a *regulated mortgage contract* as:

> The gross annual income, before tax and other deductions, of an individual taken into account by a firm to calculate the credit it will provide under a regulated mortgage contract.
