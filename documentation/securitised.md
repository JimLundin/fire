Parameter to determine whether the loan is securitised or not.

### EU Regulation

**[REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL][eu] laying down common rules on securitisation and creating a European framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation and amending Directives 2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC, 2011/61/EU and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 648/2012**:

> "Securitisation refers to transactions that enable a lender or other originator of assets – typically a credit institution – to refinance a set of loans or assets (e.g. mortgages, auto leases, consumer loans, credit cards) by converting them into securities. The lender or originator organises a portfolio of its loans into different risk categories, tailored to the risk/reward appetite of investors. Returns to investors are generated from the cash flows of the underlying loans. These markets are not aimed at retail investors."

### FCA

**Securitisation**:

> "(2) (in accordance with Article 4(36) of the [Banking Consolidation Directive (Definitions)][direu] and in BIPRU and MIPRU 4) a transaction or scheme whereby the credit risk associated with an exposure or pool of exposures is tranched having the following characteristics: (a) payments in the transaction or scheme are dependent upon the performance of the exposure or pool of exposures; and (b) the subordination of tranches determines the distribution of losses during the ongoing life of the transaction or scheme."

[direu]: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32006L0048

Further, the FCA defines a **'securitised exposure'** as:

> "(for the purposes of [BIPRU][bipru] and [MIPRU][mipru]) an exposure in the pool of exposures that has been securitised, either via a traditional securitisation or a synthetic securitisation. The cash-flows generated by the securitised exposures are used to make payments to the securitisation positions."

[mipru]: https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/MIPRU/

(... where an **'exposure'** is defined as):

*(1) (in relation to a firm but subject to (2) and (6)) the maximum loss which the firm might suffer if:
(a) a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties fail to meet their obligations; or
(b) it realises assets or off-balance sheet positions*

*(2) (in accordance with Article 77 of the Banking Consolidation Directive and for the purposes of the calculation of the credit risk capital component and the counterparty risk capital component (including BIPRU 3 (Standardised credit risk), BIPRU 4 (The IRB approach), BIPRU 5 (Credit risk mitigation), BIPRU 9 (Securitisation) an asset or off-balance sheet item.*

*(3) [delete]*

*(4) (in IFPRU and to calculate own funds requirements under Part Three Title II ( credit risk and counterparty credit risk)) has the meaning in article 5(1) of the EU CRR.*

*(5) (in IFPRU 8.2 (Large exposures) for the purpose of Part Four ((Large exposures) of the EU CRR) has the meaning in article 389 of the EU CRR (Large exposures: definitions).*
