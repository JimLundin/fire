An [International Securities Identification Number (ISIN)][wiki1] uniquely identifies a security. Its structure is defined in ISO 6166. Securities for which ISINs are issued include bonds, commercial paper, stocks and warrants. The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code that does not contain information characterizing financial instruments but serves for uniform identification of a security through normalization of the assigned National Number, where one exists, at trading and settlement.

[ISO 6166][wiki2] defines the structure of an International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a fungible security. Securities with which ISINs can be used are equities, debts, ETFs, options, derivatives, and futures.

ISINs consist of two alphabetic characters, which are the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the issuing country, nine alpha-numeric digits (the National Securities Identifying Number, or NSIN, which identifies the security), and one numeric check digit. The NSIN is issued by a national numbering agency (NNA) for that country. Regional substitute NNAs have been allocated the task of functioning as NNAs in those countries where NNAs have not yet been established.

NNAs cooperate through the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA). ANNA also functions as the ISO 6166 Registration Authority (RA).
