# value
The **value** property gives the monetary value of the collateral *as determined by the institution*. It should be noted that this is not the market value or [**mark-to-market**][mtm] of the collateral. 

While in some cases the market value will be equivalent to the **value**, for less liquid assets, such as property, the **value** will be the primary number used for calculation of risk ratios such as loan-to-value.

From the [CRR][crr]: 
> mortgage lending value means the value of immovable property as determined by a prudent assessment of the future marketability of the property taking into account long-term sustainable aspects of the property, the normal and local market conditions, the current use and alternative appropriate uses of the property;

From the [MLAR][mlar]:
> valuation is to be taken as the most recent valuation of the property which is subject to the mortgage (the existence of additional collateral on any other property should be ignored when calculating LTV). For these purposes, "recent valuation" can either be based on an actual valuation, or an estimated valuation using indexed valuation methodology applied to an original actual valuation. In the case of staged construction or self-build schemes, valuation means 'expected final value of the property' at the time the firm is committed to making the loan (i.e. takes the lending decision).
