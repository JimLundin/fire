### What is the FIRE data format?
The Financial Regulatory data format defines a common specification for granular data used for regulatory reporting. Regulatory data refers to the data that underlies regulatory submissions and is used for policy, monitoring and supervision purposes.

The FIRE data schemas and code samples are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License][apache] which has been chosen for being open, permissive and already widely accepted within financial sector (think Hadoop, Cassandra, ActiveMQ).


The FIRE data format is supported by the [European Commission][euc], the [Open Data Institute][odi] and the [Open Data Incubator for Europe][odine].

### Versioning
Each release of the FIRE schemas can be found under their respective directories (labeled "v<version>"). If there's a "-dev" suffix, that means that it's a version that's currently in development and should not yet be used in a stable production environment, as there are still changes likely to be made. Versions without the "-dev" suffix are considered stable - and although changes may still be made to them (bug fixes, documentation, etc), those changes are all guaranteed to be backwards compatible with the initial release of that version.
