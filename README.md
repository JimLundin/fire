### What is the FIRE Data Format
The Financial Regulatory data format defines a common specification for granular regulatory data. Regulatory data refers to the data that underlies regulatory submissions and is used for policy, monitoring and supervision purposes.

The FIRE data schemas and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License which has been chosen for being open, permissive and already widely accepted within financial sector (think Hadoop, Cassandra, ActiveMQ).

The FIRE data format is supported by the European Commission, the Open Data Institute and the Open Data Incubator for Europe.
